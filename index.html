          <p>Many of us share a feeling that we'd pay a little more tax if we knew it was going to the NHS.
            In fact, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/three-quarters-brits-would-pay-11955709">this survey</a> recently found that up to three-quarters of Brits would be happy to pay more to support the NHS.
            <strong>So let's do that!</strong></p>
          <p>Most NHS Trusts have a charity that you can easily set up monthly payments to, and the money will go straight into improving care in our NHS.</p>
          <p>This page will help you figure out how much money an extra 1% of tax would be for you, and help you find the page for your local NHS trust so you can set up a monthly payment of that amount.
             If we all chipped in a percent or two, it wouldn't affect us too much, but it <strong>would mean the world for our NHS</strong>.</p>
